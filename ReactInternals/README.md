## Diving Deeper into Components & React Internals

- Split an app into small components

## Stateless vs Stateful components

Stateless comp -
cost XY = () => (...)
Cant access state or lifecycle hooks
Access props via "props"
`props.XY`   

Stateful comp - 
class XY extends Component
Access state and lifecycle hooks
Access props via "this"
`this.state.XY` or `this.props.XY`

## Components Lifecycle
- When react creates component, means it get instantiated and rendered, it goes thru multiple lifecycle hooks -

Note: Only availabe in stateful components!

- constructor()
- componentWillMount()
- componentWillReceiveProps()
- shouldComponentUpdate()
- componentWillUpdate()
- componentDidUpdate()
- componentDidCatch()
- componentDidMount()
- render()
- componentWillUmount()


## Methods executed during lifecycle creation 

- constructor()
- componentWillMount()
- componentDidMount()
- render()

## Creation component lifecycle process
1. constructor(props) 
- default ES6 class feature
- react creates comp, intantiates it and pass any props that comp receives to its constructor
- when constructor is implemented, call super & pass on props - this calls construcotr of parent class & since we use this method in stateful component, parent class is Component object imported from react lib. We then can use `this.props` anwhere else inside the app.
- May intialize state in constructor
- Never cause side-effects. Eg: reaching out to web server. Response that come back, cause rerendering of app, hence performance issues. So, state becomes unpredictable


2. componentWillMount()
- This method exists for histroric reasons, don't really use it that often.
- Used for updating state, last min optimization
- Dont cause side-effect


3. render()
- Executing render method doesnt meanthat it access real DOM
- It gives idea to react, what should be rendered
- Prepare & structure jsx code
- Other sub-components are also defined here

4. `Render child components`

5. componentDidMount() 
- Tells that comp has been successfully mounted
- Can cause side-effects, and fetch some data
- Dont update state, cause it triggers re-render
- Dont immediately call setState() in componentDidMount() . It'll trigger an instant re-render process. It's fine to use it in some callback/ async code 

```
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
class App extends Component {
    state={data:'Starship'};
    getData() {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('Our data is fetched');
            this.setState({data:'Jane'});
        }, 1500);
    }
    componentDidMount(){ this.getData(); }
    render() {
        const myContainer={maxWidth:'200px',margin:'10px auto',padding:'10px 0',
                backgroundColor:'#ddd',textAlign:'center',border:'1px solid #000'};
        return (
            <div style={myContainer}>{this.state.data}</div>
        );
    }
}
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Component Creation Lifecycle in Action
Props are called only in the constructor method in a class comp. Define super inside constructor.

When constructor method is not used, react automatically reaches super under the hood. - ES7 feature

componentDidMount executes AFTER render() and therefore after all child components were rendered first and then componentDidMount  method gets executed.

There also is one Lifecycle method which gets executed (when implemented) right before a Component is removed from the DOM: `componentWillUnmount()` .

Here's an Example:

> App.js (using class App extends Component )

```
state = {
    showUserComponent: true
};
 
removeUserHandler = () => {
    this.setState({showUserComponent: false});
}
 
render() {
    return (
        <div>
            {this.state.showUserComponent ? <User /> : null}
            <button onClick={this.removeUserHandler}>Remove User Component</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

> User.js (using class User extends Component )


```
componentWillUnmount() {
    // Component is about to get removed => Perform any cleanup work here!
    console.log('I\'m about to be removed!');
}
```
In the above example, the User component is removed upon a button click (due to it being rendered conditionally and the condition result being changed to false ). This triggers componentWillUnmount()  to run in the User component right before the component is destroyed and removed from the DOM.


## Component Updating Lifecycle Hooks
Differentiate b/w updates triggered by parent, so changing props. And internally triggered updates, so by changing state.

### Component Lifecycle - Update (triggered by parent, by props)

1. componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)
- Sync component's state (if any) with the props received from parent.
- Dont cause side-effects, otherwsie causes rerendering and performance issues. 

2. shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
- Receive 2 args, the props and state which triggered this update.
- This method can cancel the updating process! Because if return true the updating continues, if return false, updating stops, you never return anything!
- If you allow update, the next lifecycle continues..

3. componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
- Again, can sync state to props

```
class PrintInColor extends Component {
    backgroundColor = 'blue' // some default
    
    componentWillUpdate(nextProps) {
        this.backgroundColor = nextProps.bgColor // passed via <PrintInColor bgColor={'red'} />
    }
 
    render() {
        return (
            <div style={this.backgroundColor}><p>Hello there</p></div>
        );
    }
}
```

- Dont cause side-effects
- Might be a better place to sync state to props bause unlike componentWillReceiveProps, here you know that you're continuing to update

4. render()
- Renders JSX- tells react  what the result will be after the update  
- Prepare and structure JSX code

5. Update child component props

6. componentDidUpdate()
- Can cause side-effect, just like in componentDidMount()
- Dont update state - triggers rerendering


Note: we write these methods like  componentDidUpdate() {..} and not  componentDidUpdate = () => {...}, since these methods are not called for DOM events, and therefore no `this` issue


### Component Lifecycle - Update (triggered by state changes/ internal change)
- By setState basically

1. shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
- May cancel updating process!
- Decide whether to continue or not
- Dont cause side effects

2. componentWillUpdate()
- Sync state to props
- Cause side-effects

3. render() 
- Prepare and structure JSX

4. Update child components

5. componentDidUpdate()
- Can cause side-effects
- Dont update state - triggers re-rendering


Note: Update triggered internally is similar to update triggered by parent, the only difference is there's no  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) lifecycle method here.


## How shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) is important?
It renders every time something changes in your app. But when you dont change state, and then too just by clicking a button, a rendering occurs whch cause performance issues.
Therefore make condtion checks, so that render doesnt occur unnecessarily.

### Performance Gains with PureComponent
For putting checks, we can avoid shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState), and `import {PureComponent}`, a special object from react lib, but it has shouldComponentUpdate check already built-in. So it will automatically compare props and state for changes and update only when it sees some changes.

https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent 
React.PureComponentâ€™s shouldComponentUpdate() only shallowly compares the objects. 
If these contain complex data structures, it may produce false-negatives for deeper differences. 
Only extend PureComponent when you expect to have simple props and state


## How React Updates the App & Component Tree
Rendering & Updates

App 
- Shop
- - List 
- - Cart

- Users
- - User1
- - User2
- - User3

Components & child components update when state or props change!


## React Updates Virtual Dom
- React renders and updates virtual DOM which compares itself with old virtual Dom , and only changes the part of app where updates occurs.
- This is faster than directly rendering on real DOM


## Returning Adjacent Elements (React 16+)
 While returning JSX, all the elements should be wrapped in a single <div>. However, if its an array, it can be returned without any wrapping.
 So instead of using <div>, we can use [] and put all JSX inside it. However every array should have key property

 Better approach



 ### HOC
If your project uses React 16.2, you can now use a built-in "Aux" component - a so called fragment.

It's actually not called Aux  but you simply use <>  - an empty JSX tag.

So the following code

```
<Aux>
    <h1>First Element</h1>
    <h1>Second Element</h1>
</Aux>
becomes

<>
    <h1>First Element</h1>
    <h1>Second Element</h1>
</>

```

Behind the scenes, it does the same our Aux component did. Or instead of <>, import {Fragment} from react, and use it as a wrapping component.

- For using className property inside hoc, make a hoc, and then define div className={props.classes}, then you can pass that classes property from the app component as <HOC classes={classes.App}>

<WithClass> or <Aux> is a standard component that also gives a template-like access (to its child),  to the classes variable (CSS).  

<Fragment> is a simplified component,  only meant for wrapping. They let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM"

Note: Another approach of using HOCs, refer lecture 96-97


HOCs are very useful. We also use HOCs provided by other packages such as connect() by Redux or withRouter() by the React router.

These HOCs allow us to easily "inject" extra properties/ features into our components without us needing to re-write them.


## Using setState correctly

If you have to change state inside setState for primitves(counter no.), so instead of doing this.setState({something:  this.state.something+1}), use prevState.something + 1.
Because in fromer method, you can interfere with state version, if state is changing at many place, since setState is a async func, you might not have current state. So prevState solves it.

```
togglePersonsHandler = () => {
    const doesShow = this.state.showPersons;
    this.setState((prevState, props) => {
      return {
        showPersons: !doesShow,
        toggleClicked: prevState.toggleClicked + 1
      }
    });
  }
  ```


The "danger" of not using it is that you access this.state  right after calling this.setState  or inside of this.setState  and you actually get a "wrong" old state . So if you had a counter in your state, you might want to increment it.

Doing this.setState({counter: this.state.counter + 1})  MIGHT work but could also skip a value because the state updates happen asynchronously.


## Validating Props (PropTypes)
- Useful when working in a team
- Restrict types & values received for props. Eg props.age is a number
- Install npm install --save  prop-types. It gives utility features to check prop types.
- PropTypes is a js object, where keys are properties, and values are type

### Available PropTypes

Source: https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html

```
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
 
MyComponent.propTypes = {
  // You can declare that a prop is a specific JS primitive. By default, these
  // are all optional.
  optionalArray: PropTypes.array,
  optionalBool: PropTypes.bool,
  optionalFunc: PropTypes.func,
  optionalNumber: PropTypes.number,
  optionalObject: PropTypes.object,
  optionalString: PropTypes.string,
  optionalSymbol: PropTypes.symbol,

  // Anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array
  // (or fragment) containing these types.
  optionalNode: PropTypes.node,
 
  // A React element.
  optionalElement: PropTypes.element,
 
  // You can also declare that a prop is an instance of a class. This uses
  // JS's instanceof operator.
  optionalMessage: PropTypes.instanceOf(Message),
 
  // You can ensure that your prop is limited to specific values by treating
  // it as an enum.
  optionalEnum: PropTypes.oneOf(['News', 'Photos']),
 
  // An object that could be one of many types
  optionalUnion: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.number,
    PropTypes.instanceOf(Message)
  ]),
 
  // An array of a certain type
  optionalArrayOf: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number),
 
  // An object with property values of a certain type
  optionalObjectOf: PropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.number),
 
  // An object taking on a particular shape
  optionalObjectWithShape: PropTypes.shape({
    color: PropTypes.string,
    fontSize: PropTypes.number
  }),
 
  // You can chain any of the above with `isRequired` to make sure a warning
  // is shown if the prop isn't provided.
  requiredFunc: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
 
  // A value of any data type
  requiredAny: PropTypes.any.isRequired,
 
  // You can also specify a custom validator. It should return an Error
  // object if the validation fails. Don't `console.warn` or throw, as this
  // won't work inside `oneOfType`.
  customProp: function(props, propName, componentName) {
    if (!/matchme/.test(props[propName])) {
      return new Error(
        'Invalid prop `' + propName + '` supplied to' +
        ' `' + componentName + '`. Validation failed.'
      );
    }
  },
 
  // You can also supply a custom validator to `arrayOf` and `objectOf`.
  // It should return an Error object if the validation fails. The validator
  // will be called for each key in the array or object. The first two
  // arguments of the validator are the array or object itself, and the
  // current item's key.
  customArrayProp: PropTypes.arrayOf(function(propValue, key, componentName, location, propFullName) {
    if (!/matchme/.test(propValue[key])) {
      return new Error(
        'Invalid prop `' + propFullName + '` supplied to' +
        ' `' + componentName + '`. Validation failed.'
      );
    }
  })
};

```

Requiring Single Child
With PropTypes.element you can specify that only a single child can be passed to a component as children.

```
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
 
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // This must be exactly one element or it will warn.
    const children = this.props.children;
    return (
      <div>
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
 
MyComponent.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.element.isRequired
};
```

Default Prop Values

You can define default values for your props by assigning to the special defaultProps property:

```
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
    );
  }
}
 
// Specifies the default values for props:
Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Stranger'
};
 
// Renders "Hello, Stranger":
ReactDOM.render(
  <Greeting />,
  document.getElementById('example')
);
```

The defaultProps will be used to ensure that this.props.name will have a value if it was not specified by the parent component. The propTypes typechecking happens after defaultProps are resolved, so typechecking will also apply to the defaultProps.



## Using References("ref")
- Used mostly when focusing text inputs
- Only used in class comp

```
 <input ref={(input) => { this.inputElement = input }} />
```
Here input refers to the element whose ref you're passing, so you're making a special property this.InputElement and assigning your element to it.

- Refer to that ref in method called after render, like componentDidMount()

 ```
 componentDidMount() {
        if (this.props.position === 0) {
            this.inputElement.focus();
        };
 }
```

> Note:
React 16.3+ has introduced React,createRef()
 //create a ref to store the textInput DOM element
// this.inputElement =  React.createRef();


### The context API (React 16.3)
React.createContext() for assigning some global state. Instead of passing state via props to diff component, this is easy step, The Context API should be used for state that affects a lot of components, possibly in multiple tree branches. Useful for setting authentication, or bg color
 - Has provider and consumer property

 ### Additional lifecycle hooks (React 16.3)
 getDerivedStateFromProps()
 getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()


Some lifecycle methods are deprecated
Following the official docs (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#unsafe_componentwillreceiveprops), some lifecycle methods should now be prefixed with "UNSAFE_". Seems like these lifecycle hooks will get deprecated in React v17:
componentWillMount
componentWillReceiveProps
componentWillUpdate
