# Rendering Lists & Conditional Content
Creating truly dynamic apps

## How to output dynamic list

Note: if/else cant be used inside JSX. Only simple statements can be written, no block statements. So use ternary expressions.

- - For outputting any dynamic content, wrap it in curly braces, even if thats a div containing list of components. Javascript expressions can be injected inside jsx with {}.
